<NOTICE>
This software is deprecated and will not work anymore!

However there is a working alternative:
https://github.com/DIGITALCRIMINAL/OnlyFans
</NOTICE>

Archives videos and images from onlyfans.com profiles.
Nothing more nothing less.

Installation:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
- Use your browser to log in on onlyfans.com
- Find the cookie called 'sess' and copy the id
- Find the User-Agent string of your browser and copy it as well
- ./ofgrab.py <PROFILE_NAME> <YOUR_SESSION_ID> <USER_AGENT_STRING>

Trivia:
- In the JSON payload for each post there’s a field called "fake_favorites_count".
  Haven’t found any JS code which makes use of it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if
  they have some monkey business going on.
